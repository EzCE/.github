# EzCE

We make stuff for calculators (usually the TI eZ80 models)! This group serves as a collection for projects that we ([RoccoLox Programs](https://github.com/roccoloxprograms/) and [TIny_Hacker](https://github.com/TIny-Hacker/)) work on together, to keep them all under the same name. A few of our previous group efforts (most notably [CEaShell](https://github.com/roccoloxprograms/shell)) can be found under our individual profiles, but everything new will be here.
