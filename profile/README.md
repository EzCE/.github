# EzCE

A calculator programming group

## Focus

We enjoy working on projects that focus on features and ease-of-use, and we 
strive to create things that others will find useful as well.

## Why a group?

Since we work on a lot of projects together, it makes the most sense to
host them all under a group. Some of our previous group projects, like [CEaShell](https://github.com/roccoloxprograms/shell),
will remain under the previous owner so past links to the repository aren't
confusing. There are also be other cool projects we work on
independently, so be sure to check those out as well!
