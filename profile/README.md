# EzCE

A calculator programming group

## Focus

We enjoy working on projects that focus on features and ease-of-use, and we 
strive to create things that others will find useful as well.

## Why a group?

Since we work on most of our projects together, it makes the most sense to
compile them into a group. Some of our previous projects, like [CEaShell](https://github.com/roccoloxprograms/shell)
will remain under the previous owner so past links to the repository aren't
confusing. There may also be other cool projects that members work on
independently, so be sure to check those out as well!
